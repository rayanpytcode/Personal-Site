                skills include multitasking, delegating responsibilities and making critical business decisions.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Entrepreneur must be able to communicate effectively with clients, team members and all other
                stakeholders. Whether through verbal communication during meetings or sending reports and messages
                through
                emails about the project, entrepreneurs require superior written and verbal communication. Apart from
                communication skills, entrepreneurs must be excellent listeners to understand the project's requirement
                and
                discussion during project meetings.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Being able to take calculated and intelligent risks is one of the essential entrepreneur skills to learn.
                Employees with an entrepreneur mindset never shy away from taking risks because they understand that
                calculated risks result in tremendous success. They know that risk is an opportunity to learn and grow a
                business to the next level. Employers want candidates who can take risks in pursuit of potential gains
                and
                profit.</p>

        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Networking involves building and managing relationship with other professionals to grow and promote a
                business. Effective networking skills open up future opportunities and help build a solid brand.
                Networking allows entrepreneurs to meet like-minded professionals, build future teams and stay
                up-to-date with industry
                trends.It is one of the most desirable skills for entrepreneurs because, through a solid network, they
                can meet professionals to fund their ideas, access professional business expertise and get feedback on
                their new
                venture or idea.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Critical thinking is an entrepreneur skill that objectively analyses the information and draws a rational
                conclusion. It helps entrepreneurs assess a situation and come up with a logical solution. Employers
                look for candidates with critical thinking because it helps solve problems and build strategies for
                business growth. Usually, a critical thinker is independent, competent and reflective. This skill helps
                entrepreneurs logically connect ideas, scrutinise information, evaluate arguments, find inconsistencies
                in work and solve complex issues. Instead of memorising information, such candidates use the information
                to deduce meaningful insights.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Often, entrepreneurs face challenging and unexpected situations. It could be a venture capitalist
                refusing further funding or a team member refusing to work as per the project guidelines; an
                entrepreneur must possess excellent problem-solving skills to handle stressful situations and calmly
                identify alternate solutions. Exceptional problem-solving skills ensure they reach their business goal.
            </p>

        <li>
            <p>Creativity is a valuable yet underappreciated skill in the digital world. Creative thinking is the
                backbone for innovation and it forces employees to think differently. Entrepreneurs with creative
                thinking skills are never hesitant to try solutions that others may overlook because of fear of failure.
                Such people think out-of-the-box and always seek input from professionals in a different field for
                understanding a new perspective. It is one of the most sought-after entrepreneur skills because it
                allows them to see patterns (even when there are no patterns) and develop innovative ways to solve
                business issues.</p>

        <li>
            <p>Quality customer service promotes the brand and increases loyalty. Regardless of the industry, excellent
                customer service skills are essential for business success. From talking to clients to discussing
                funding opportunities, customer service skills help entrepreneurs connect with their potential
                customers.</p>
        </li>

        <li>

                financial processes. By learning financial skills, entrepreneurs avoid overspending and optimally
                allocate resources.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Being able to inspire colleagues, empower the workforce and lead from the front requires excellent
                leadership skills. Exemplary leaders lead by examples and can take a leadership role and work as a part
                of a team. Entrepreneurs with leadership skills motivate their employees, manage operations and delegate
                tasks to reach the business goal.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Effective time management increases productivity and organises your workspace. Entrepreneurs with time
                management and organisational skills understand different ways to prioritise tasks and avoid
                procrastination. For ensuring timely completion of projects, entrepreneurs analyse their and their
                team's time, set time limit for each task, complete priority tasks first, delegate work to others,
                create a to-do list and use technology to keep the workspace organised.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Technical skills are hard skills that are gained by using digital tools and software. Entrepreneurs must
                know how to use planning, marketing and budgeting software. Knowledge of software helps in managing
                projects, tracking sales and allocating a viable budget for the project.</p>
